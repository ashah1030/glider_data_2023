NOAA Hollings 2024: Using autonomous glider data to understand productivity regimes in a warming Bering Sea

Welcome to my NOAA Hollings project! This is a project I worked on for 10 weeks during summer 2024. It combines data analysis techniques (python pandas and xarray) with geographic plotting and raster data (qGIS and python cartopy) and machine learning techniques (python scikit learn). The project provides an in depth data analysis of the relationship between salinity, temperature, and chlorophyll across various areas of the Southeastern Bering Sea. Such an analysis is heightened with new high resolution data from the Oculus seaglider. 

This code shows most of the machinery behind the project, please feel free to contact me with any questions or if you are curious about some more detailed results.
